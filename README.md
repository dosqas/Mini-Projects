# Mini-Projects

A collection of small but impactful projects developed for internship applications and coding challenges. Each project demonstrates my ability to quickly build functional solutions while showcasing proficiency in different languages, frameworks, and problem-solving techniques.

### Key Highlights  
‚úî **Rapid Development** ‚Äì Solutions built in 1-2 days  
‚úî **Diverse Tech Stack** ‚Äì C#, Java, file I/O, data validation, and algorithms  
‚úî **Real-World Applicability** ‚Äì CSV/JSON processing, optimization considerations

## Projects  

### üñ•Ô∏è C# Canvas & Rectangle Overlap Analyzer  
A console application that:  
- Takes user input for canvas dimensions (origin at bottom-left).  
- Reads rectangle coordinates from `input.txt`.  
- Performs four key analyses:  
  1. **Filtering** ‚Äì Lists rectangles fully within the canvas.  
  2. **Overlap Detection** ‚Äì Identifies non-overlapping rectangles.  
  3. **Nesting Check** ‚Äì Finds rectangles entirely enclosed by others.
  4. **Uncovered Area Calculation** - Calculates the area of the canvas not covered by rectangles
- Includes discussions on optimizations for calculating uncovered areas.  

### üìä Java Internship Applicant Processor  
A data processing system that:  
- **Validates & cleans** CSV data (names, emails, scores).  
- **Adjusts scores** dynamically (bonuses/penalties for submission timing).  
- **Generates analytics**:  
  - Unique applicant count  
  - Top 3 applicants by adjusted score (last names only)  
  - Average score of the top 50% pre-adjustment  
- Uses **Java Streams** for memory efficiency and outputs results in **JSON**.

## Why It Matters  
Though small in scope, these projects reflect:  
- **Code quality** ‚Äì Validation, error handling, and clean architecture.  
- **Problem-solving** ‚Äì Logical approaches to constraints (e.g., overlap checks).  
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Stream-based processing for large datasets.
